<h4> When questioned about his utterly humiliating tweets, Aniketh Malyala refused to feel shame for almost all of them, stating that "It was back in 2014". However, some of the tweets date up until 2016, so this claim is in fact false. Let us hope that Mr. Malyala, more commonly know by his nicknames of 'FirestarXYZ' or 'Anibunny', will one day feel the weight of his sins. </h4>
